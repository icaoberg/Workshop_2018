## Repository for CellBlender models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2018 Workshop.

This directory contains files and documentation for the CellBlender portion of the 2018 Workshop.

This is the basic "Organelle" model that we have used in other tutorials. This particular version
was completely generated within CellBlender.

This is a version of the "Organelle" model with geometry generated in CellOrganizer and imported
into CellBlender. This model can be run by downloading "cell1.json" and importing as CellBlender Model
and Geometry (JSON). The model can then be run in MCell (Run Simulation), and displayed as shown here:
