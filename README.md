# Workshop 2016
## Repository for models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2016 Workshop.

Ideally we would like the 2016 workshop to demonstrate a pipelining of our tools using a single multi-scale model. However, since many of our tools operate on different scales, it may be necessary to simplify certain aspects of the model or otherwise address the multi-scale issue so it will be manageable within the time and computational constraints of the workshop.

This repository has been created as a place to work out an appropriate model for the workshop consistent with our February 25th decision.

At this point, the candidate tools for such a joint model are:

* **[CellBlender](cellblender)**
* **[CellOrganizer](cellorganizer)**
* **[BioNetGen](bionetgen)**
* **[MCell](mcell)**

Please feel free to add/delete tools that might participate in this portion of the workshop.

As of March 31st, we have a preliminary model from CellOrganizer with an organelle added by CellBlender:
